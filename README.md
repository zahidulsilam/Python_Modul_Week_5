Question1: Create a Python class called "Rectangle" that represents a rectangle. The Rectangle class must have the following properties and methods:
##### Features:
- width (an integer)
- height (an integer)
##### Methods:
- area(self): A method that calculates and returns the area of ​​the rectangle.
- perimeter(self): A method that calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
- Create an instance of Rectangle class, set its width to 5 and height to 7, then print its area and perimeter.
##
Question2: Create a "School" class in Python. This class should have the following features and functionality:

##### Features:
- "name"
- "foundation_year"
- "students"
- "teachers"
-
##### Methods:
- add_new_student(self, student_name, class): A method used to add a new student to the school. It takes the student's name and class and adds it to the "students" list.
- add_new_teacher(self, teacher_name, branch): A method used to add a new teacher to the school. It takes the teacher's name and major and adds it to the "teachers" dictionary.
- view_student_list(self): A method used to display the list of students enrolled in the school. List student names and classes.
- view_teacher_list(self): A method used to display the list of teachers working in the school. List teacher names and majors.
##
Question3: Create a "Shape" class. Under this class, create two subclasses, the "Rectangle" and "Square" classes.

- Let the "shape" class have two properties: "width" and "height."
- Let the "Rectangle" class inherit from the "Shape" class and add an additional "calculate_area()" method.
- Let the "Square" class inherit from the "Shape" class and calculate the area of ​​the square using the same "area_calculate()" method.
- Create a "Rectangle" and a "Square" instance, determine the width and height of each, and calculate the area of ​​each and print the results.
##
Question4: Create a "Vehicle" class in Python. Make sure this class has the following properties:

##### Features:
- "make" (Brand of vehicle)
- "model" (Vehicle model)
- "year" (Year of manufacture of the vehicle)

Create a "Vehicle" class and create two derived subclasses, "Off-Road Vehicle" (SUV) and "SportsCar" classes.

- The "Off-Road Vehicle" class inherits from the "Vehicle" class and adds an additional "four_wheel drive" feature.
- Let the "SportCar" class inherit from the "Vehicle" class and add a "max_speed" property.

Create an instance of each class, determine its properties, and write a program to display these properties.
##
 Question5: Create a "Customer" class and an "Account" class. Let the "Account" class inherit from the "Customer" class and represent a customer's bank account information.

##### Customer Class Features:
- "name" (customer name)
- "surname" (customer surname)
- "tc_identification" (customer TR ID number)
- "phone" (customer phone number)

##### Account Class Properties:
- "customer" (a Customer object)
- "account_number" (account number)
- "balance" (account balance)

##### Customer Class Method:
- "display_information()": Displays the customer's name, surname, TR ID number and telephone number.

##### Account Class Methods:
- "deposit(self, amount)": A method that deposits a certain amount of money into the account.
- "money_check(self, amount)": A method that withdraws a certain amount of money from the account. However, if there is not enough balance in the account, the transaction should not occur and a message should be displayed.
- "display_balance()": A method that displays the account balance.

Create these two classes, then create a Customer object and an Account object, add the customer information to the Account object, and perform account operations and view the results.
